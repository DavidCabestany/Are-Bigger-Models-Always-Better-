## Overview

Language Models (LMs) have shown an exponential growth in size and popularity during the last decades. This growth has been measured by the number of parameters and the size of the training data used. This project compares the performance of the large-scale BERT model with the smaller DistilBERT model, both pre-trained with Masked Language Modeling and used for sentimental classification on the same dataset.

## Why this Study

The popularity impact of LMs in Deep Learning and NLP field created a competition that in the beginning was about achieving better performances, but it seemed to resume on the idea ‚Äúthe more quantity, the more quality‚Äù. However, recent studies have highlighted the risks of large LMs, including biases, harmful learning patterns, and high environmental and financial costs. 

This project aims to challenge this "bigger is better" mindset and investigates whether smaller models like DistilBERT can be as effective as larger ones like BERT while being more efficient and environmentally friendly.

## Methodologies

1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** - A broadly used pre-training method in NLP for learning text representations.
2. **Transfer Learning** - The technique involves transferring the knowledge from a set of tasks to a new similar task.
3. **Few and Zero-shot Learning** - Techniques to create deep learning models that learn how to generalize with a low (or null) quantity of examples.

## Tools and Models

1. **BERT** - Transformer-based model for language representation that uses unlabelled text for pre-training bidirectional representations.
2. **DistilBERT** - A smaller, more efficient version of BERT obtained through knowledge distillation that shows comparable performance on many downstream tasks.

## Learning Methods

Currently, models achieve remarkable results when trained with large amounts of labeled data. However, labeled datasets are not always available due to resources like time, human effort, and financial support. Therefore, this study employs few-shot and zero-shot learning techniques, which aim to create a deep learning model that learns how to generalize with a low (or null) quantity of examples.

## Dataset

This study uses the Amazon product data created by Julian McAuley for sentiment analysis in text classification. Specifically, we chose the 'Movies and TV' category from the dataset, extracting 10,000 reviews from the 5-core subset.

## Results

For detailed results, including confusion matrices and performance metrics for few-shot and zero-shot learning for both DistilBERT and BERTBase, please refer to the original paper. In summary, while BERTBase showed slightly higher results in some scenarios, DistilBERT demonstrated a fairly good behaviour even when the number of parameters is lower than BERTBase. 

## Implications

The findings of this project challenge the notion that larger LMs are inherently superior. It shows that smaller models like DistilBERT can compete effectively in terms of performance while also being more efficient and environmentally friendly.
